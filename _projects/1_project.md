# Introduction

CrossFit is a high-intensity fitness program that combines elements of weightlifting, cardio, and gymnastics. It aims to improve overall physical fitness by incorporating constantly varied functional movements performed at a high intensity. At the pinnacle of CrossFit is the CrossFit Games, an annual competition that showcases the world's fittest athletes. The CrossFit Games serve as a platform for elite athletes to test their skills and compete in a wide range of demanding workouts, challenging their strength, speed, power, and mental resilience. In this analysis, we will delve into the performance of CrossFit athletes, examining key factors that contribute to their success in this highly demanding and competitive sport.  

In this comprehensive two-part project, we first clean highly disorganized survey data profiling athletes competing in the CrossFit games. This data encompasses their age, height, weight, training habits (including rest days and sessions per day), geographic location, eating habits (such as measuring food, adhering to paleo or quality eating practices), and performance data. Features are engineered for a more insightful analysis of athlete performance, enabling us to uncover valuable trends and patterns. Notably, strong relationships were found between performance and athlete age, body composition and gender and athlete performance.

In the second part of this project, we use this data to predict athlete performance. Three models are made to this end using common regression models: 

 - Random forest 
 - XGBoost
 - Dense neural network

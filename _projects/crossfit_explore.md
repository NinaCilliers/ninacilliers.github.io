# A data-based approach to CrossFit training 

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

CrossFit is a high-intensity fitness program that combines elements of weightlifting, cardio, and gymnastics. It aims to improve overall physical fitness by incorporating constantly varied functional movements performed at a high intensity. At the pinnacle of CrossFit is the CrossFit Games, an annual competition that showcases the world's fittest athletes. The CrossFit Games serve as a platform for elite athletes to test their skills and compete in a wide range of demanding workouts, challenging their strength, speed, power, and mental resilience. In this analysis, we will delve into the performance of CrossFit athletes, examining key factors that contribute to their success in this highly demanding and competitive sport.  

In this comprehensive review of survey data from the CrossFit games, we first clean highly disorganized survey data profiling athletes competing in the CrossFit games. This data encompasses age, height, weight, training habits (including rest days and sessions per day), geographic location, eating habits (such as measuring food, adhering to paleo or quality eating practices), and performance data. Features are engineered for a more insightful analysis of athlete performance, enabling us to uncover valuable trends and patterns. We then look at how these factors correlate with athlete performance to gain valuable insight for athletes, coaches and future survey construction. 

The dataset used in this project was provided by Ulrik Pedersen and can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/crossfit-athletes).

<h2>Data cleaning</h2>

### Event selection
Data that is not relevant to our analysis was removed from consideration along with the less frequently performed fitness events. It was necessary to remove these less common events to maintain a large dataset.


```python
df = df.dropna(subset=['region','age','weight','height','howlong','gender','eat','train','background','experience','schedule','howlong','deadlift','candj','snatch','backsq','experience','background','schedule','howlong']) #removing NaNs from parameters of interest 
df = df.drop(columns=['affiliate','team','name','athlete_id','fran','helen','grace','filthy50','fgonebad','run400','run5k','pullups','train']) #removing paramters not of interest + less popular events
```


```python
msno.matrix(df, figsize=(14,6),fontsize=11);
```


    
![missing data](\assets\img\crossfit_explore\output_8_0.png)
    


### Outlier Removal

Only clear outliers were removed from the dataset. These outliers are suspected to be the result of data entry errors and were diagnosed from highly inprobable heights and weights and performances in events exceeding current world records. Only adults and male and female competitors were considered in this analysis.


```python
#removing problematic entries 
df = df[df['weight'] < 1500] #removes two anomolous weight entries of 1,750 and 2,113
df = df[df['gender']!='--'] #removes 9 non-male/female gender entries due to small sample size
df = df[df['age']>=18] #only considering adults 
df = df[(df['height']<96)&(df['height']>48)]#selects people between 4 and 8 feet

#no lifts above world recording holding lifts were included
df = df[(df['deadlift']>0)&(df['deadlift']<=1105)|((df['gender']=='Female')&(df['deadlift']<=636))] #removes negative deadlift weights and deadlifts above the current world record
df = df[(df['candj']>0)&(df['candj']<=395)]#|((df['gender']=='Female')&(df['candj']<=265))] #removes negative clean and jerk value and reported weights above the current world record
df = df[(df['snatch']>0)&(df['snatch']<=496)]#|((df['gender']=='Female')&(df['snatch']<=341))] #removes weights above the current world record 
df = df[(df['backsq']>0)&(df['backsq']<=1069)]#|((df['gender']=='Female')&(df['backsq']<=615))] #removes weights over current world record
```

### Cleaning survey data

Survey responses were cleaned and encoded. Problematically, multiple survey questions were collated into single responses on eating, background, training, and CrossFit experience. This means, for example, that if someone had worked as a CrossFit trainer, completed a CrossFit course, started doing CrossFit alone and declined to answer if they found CrossFit life changing, that all responses would be combined into one answer on experience. Similarly, it is possible for a single response to contain contradictory information. For instance, a respondent could indicate that they have no previous athletic background and were also a college athlete.

Thus, cleaning this data set, separating answers into individual question responses and removing non-sensical responses is non-trivial. Non-sensical survey responses were removed from consideration, and responses were organized to the best extent possible. 


```python
#get rid of declines to answer as only response 
decline_dict = {'Decline to answer|':np.nan}
df = df.replace(decline_dict)
df = df.dropna(subset=['background','experience','schedule','howlong','eat'])
```

### Normalizing lifts

It is customary in powerlifting to normalize the weight lifted to the bodyweight of the athlete. This corrects for the physical advantage of leverage and isolates the athletic contribution to a lift.


```python
df['norm_dl'] = df['deadlift']/df['weight']
df['norm_j'] = df['candj']/df['weight']
df['norm_s'] = df['snatch']/df['weight']
df['norm_bs'] = df['backsq']/df['weight']

df['total_lift'] = df['norm_dl']+df['norm_j']+df['norm_s']+df['norm_bs']
```

### Calculating body mass index (BMI)
BMI is a measure of body composition based on weight and height. It categorizes individuals as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese, and can be used as a starting point to set fitness goals. However, BMI does not distinguish between muscle and fat and can mistake highly muscular individuals as overweight.


```python
df['BMI'] = df['weight']*0.453592/np.square(df['height']*0.0254)

df = df[(df['BMI']>=17)&(df['BMI']<=50)]#considers only underweight - morbidly obese competitors
```
<h2><br></h2>
<h2>Event performance</h2>

Before exploring responses, we examine the normalized performance for the male and female athletes surveyed. The distributions are approximately normal in all cases, but the snatch and clean and jerk events have a wider distribution. This is likely the result of the importance of technique in these events, which leads to wider variation in addition to natural differences in strength.


```python
plt.style.use('ggplot')
from matplotlib.pylab import rcParams
rcParams['figure.figsize'] = 10,6
```


```python
xlabel = 'Lift in body weight'
plt.subplot(221)
sns.histplot(data = df, x = 'norm_dl', hue='gender',kde = True);
plt.title('Deadlift')
plt.xlabel(xlabel)

<h2>Athlete demographics and performance</h2>

Athlete demographics were collected as part of provided survey:
- Gender 
- BMI (from height and weight)
- Age
- Region

We explore the data and look for correlations with performance.

### Gender

Male competitors outnumber female competitors by 2.6 to 1. This is unsurprising as CrossFit is a strength-based sport, which typically attracts men. 


```python
sns.histplot(data = df, x = 'gender', hue = 'gender', hue_order = ['Female','Male'])
#df.groupby('gender').agg('count') #20996/7999
```

 ![gender lift histogram](\assets\img\crossfit_explore\output_29_1.png)   
    


We see expected gender differences in performance between the male and female groups. Male athletes outlifted female athletes on a body weight normalized basis by 24.5%. 


```python
sns.boxplot(x=df.gender, y=df.total_lift)
plt.ylabel('Total lift (bodyweight)')

#df[['total_lift','gender']].groupby('gender').agg('mean') #(6.05-4.86)/4.86
```

![mean age lifts](\assets\img\crossfit_explore\output_31_1.png) 
    


### BMI

The distributions of heights and weights of CrossFit competitors are not smooth despite the large sample size. However, converting these non-independent metrics to BMI results in normal distributions with a positive skew that is particularly pronounced in the male population. 


```python
#Mean BMI
def standard_error(x):
    stdev = x.std()
    counts = x.count()

![BMI](\assets\img\crossfit_explore\output_35_0.png)    
    


The figures below show BMI and total lift unaggregated in the left plot and aggregated to the nearest BMI with standard error in the right plot. Male athletes tend towards higher BMIs and lift more weight as expected. Interestingly, there appears to be a strong dependency between BMI and total lift with performance peaks observed at BMIs of 23 kg/m2 and 27 kg/m2 for female and male athletes respectively. Likely, this represents athletes gaining more muscle and eventually more fat, as more muscle would help performance and more fat would adversely affect performance. Thus, this analysis suggests that male and female athletes should adjust their training and diet to reach BMIs of 27 and 23 respectively with lean body compositions.

### Age 

The age distributions for male and female athletes is approximately normal with a slight positive skew that is more pronounced for female athletes. The mean ages for both male and female populations was 32. 


```python
sns.histplot(data = df, x = 'age', hue='gender',binwidth=1,kde = True)
plt.show()
#df[['gender','age']].groupby('gender').agg('mean')
```


 ![age data](\assets\img\crossfit_explore\output_39_0.png)   
    


The normalized total lift for all athletes is shown against age in the figure on the left below. Male competitors lift slightly more, and a general decrease in performance past 25 is apparent. This data is grouped to the nearest BMI and shown with standard error on the plot on the right. Male performance shows a clear peak around 20 years of age, and female performance maintains a plateau until around 30 years of age. Both populations show distinct decreases in performance with increased age.

Interestingly, male performance appears to be more sensitive to age than female performance. Testosterone is extremely important to building and maintaining muscle and strength, and it is possible that declines in testosterone characteristic to male aging underly this observation. Slower recovery with age in both genders is likely also a significant factor of age-related decline. 


```python
df_age = df[['age','gender','total_lift']].groupby(['age','gender']).agg(['mean',standard_error,'size']).sort_values('age').reset_index()
df_age_f = df_age[(df_age['gender']=='Female')&(df_age['total_lift']['size']>5)]
df_age_m = df_age[(df_age['gender']=='Male')&(df_age['total_lift']['size']>5)]

### Region

Most competitors are based in the US, and CrossFit appears to be particularly popular in California. Outside the US, the most popular locations for CrossFit are Canada and Europe.


```python
plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plt.title('Region')
sns.histplot(data = df, x = 'region')
plt.xlabel('')
plt.xticks(rotation = 90)

plt.bar('non-US',(df.shape[0]-df['US'].sum()))

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```


![region](\assets\img\crossfit_explore\output_43_0.png)   


CrossFit athletes in the US appear to slightly outperform CrossFit athletes outside of the US. This could be due to increased local competition driving athletes to higher levels of performance or access to sophisticated training facilities and experienced coaches. 


```python

<h2>Lifestyle factors</h2>

Training and lifestyle choices are important factors for athlete performance. The following factors were surveyed:

- CrossFit age (time doing CrossFit)
- Two-a-day training session frequency
- Frequency of rest days 
- Athletic history 
- Eating habits

We examine these responses and identify key factors for improved performance. Histograms of these survey responses are shown below.

Key take-aways: 

- Most CrossFit athletes wait to participate in the CrossFit games until they have some experience with the sport under their belt. 

- It is unusual for athletes to do CrossFit for more than four years, possibly due to the intensity of the training sessions in terms of time commitment and potential for injury. 

- Most athletes adhere to the recommended 1 day per week rest day schedule. 

- Most athletes have some athletic background prior to starting CrossFit. 

Next, we look at how these factors correlate to performance.

CrossFit age (years doing CrossFit), frequency of two-a-day session, taking sufficient rest days, and athletic background all correlate with improved athletic performance as would be expected from conventional knowledge. Interestingly, starting CrossFit alone rather than at a facility with a coach appears to also correlate with improved performance. This is perhaps indirectly a result of self-starting athletes having a stronger athletic history. Reported eating habits, however, do not appear strongly correlated with performance. 

<h2><br></h2>
<h2>Has CrossFit been life changing?</h2>

Previous analysis focused on athlete attributes and lifestyle. Survey respondents were additionally asked if CrossFit has been life changing, and this reponse can be used to isolate and guage the effect of attitude on performance. 


```python
changed = df['life_changing'].sum()
not_changed = df.shape[0]-changed #non-answers are considered non-life changing responses

plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plt.pie([not_changed, changed],labels=['Not life changing','Life changing'])

plt.subplot(1,2,2)
sns.boxplot(x = df.life_changing, y=df.total_lift)
plt.ylabel('Total Lift (bodyweight)')
plt.xlabel('Is crossfit lifechanging?')
plt.tight_layout()
```


![life changing](\assets\img\crossfit_explore\output_52_0.png)    
    


Interestingly, strong positive attitudes towards CrossFit do not appear to correlate with improved performance. This is counter intuitive as enjoying the ritual and community of CrossFit should increase the likelihood of continuing to train and participate in CrossFit.

<h2><br>/h2<>
<h2>Feature correlation</h2>

The Pearson correlation coefficient is a statistical measure that quantifies the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, and 0 indicates no linear correlation. Frequency of two-a-day training sessions, completing a level 1 certification, starting CrossFit alone, and working as a CrossFit trainer are all correlated to improved performance, while having no athletic background prior to CrossFit is correlated to worse performance. 

The strong non-linear correlations between performance and BMI and age are not captured in the above matrix. It is important to note that the Pearson correlation coefficient only measures linear relationships and may not capture non-linear associations or other types of relationships between variables.

<h2>Conclusion and recommendations</h2>

The results of this investigation indicate that key factors for CrossFit athlete performance are body composition, age, and gender. Other contributing factors include CrossFit age (years doing CrossFit), frequency of two-a-day sessions, taking sufficient rest days, and athletic background. Interestingly, passion for CrossFit and dietary choices did not correlate with athlete performance. 

CrossFit athletes are encouraged to follow a paleo diet. A modern paleo diet includes fruits, vegetables, lean meats, eggs, nuts and seeds and is not calorie or macro based. However, adherence to a paleo diet is uncorrelated with athlete performance. To better understand how athlete diet influences performance, additional questions could be added to future surveys. For example, caloric intake and protein consumption may be better predictors of performance, as sufficient protein and fuel are required to build and maintain muscle. If these features can be correlated with improved performance, CrossFit as an organization may have sufficient grounds to restructure their dietary recommendations for athletes. 

Finally, this data indicates that the key factors for athlete performance are largely predetermined by age and gender. However, there are key take aways for athletes seeking to improve their performance from their baseline: 
- Athletes should target lean body compositions and BMIs of 23 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and 27 mg/m<sup>

2</sup> for females and males respectively.

- Training should be managed for long-term adherence to CrossFit. While taking an overly aggressive approach to training may seem advantageous, the data indicates that there is a high risk of burnout or injury after four years, while performance continues to improve with CrossFit experience. 

- Adding two-a-day training sessions is beneficial to performance with no apparent risk of overtraining. 

- Taking one rest day a week will improve performance without adverse effects.

I have a proven track record of using data to solve problems. After eight years as a scientist, my focus has shifted to data science and machine learning. Over the past six months, I have taken a rigorous, self-directed course that will enable me to excel in my next position. While I am self-taught, I look forward to showcasing my portfolio and technical acumen.  I welcome all inquiries and am open to opportunities that align with my interests:

- Machine learning
- Deep learning
- Python (Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib +)
- Classification and regression (SVM, tree-based, XGBoost, and linear models)
- Neural networks 
- Data visualization 
- Unsupervised learning 
- Interpretable AI
- Statistics
- Biophysics 
- Project management
- Technical communication

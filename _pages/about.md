I am a seasoned professional with a background in scientific exploration and now data science. I have a PhD in chemical engineering and completed my thesis in active matter and soft matter characterization, fields that build upon my passion for math and physics. In my professional journey, I have formulated plant-based products as a biopolymer scientist and led a team in a drive to characterize a novel plant-based food protein, RuBisCO, and improve an industrial extraction process. 

In my last role, I used process and quality assurance data to build a random forest classification model to predict a key production metric. I had always enjoyed programming and had a basic mastery of Python from my academic projects. Working on this predictive model ignited a passion for data science. I began taking online classes and ultimately decided to change careers. 

As a data scientist,  I am passionate about learning and developing new technical skills. I have built a portfolio showcasing some of my projects. My key areas of interest include machine learning, predictive modeling, data visualization, computer vision, and unstructured data analysis. I am currently seeking roles that utilize my strong technical skill set and welcome all inquiries.
